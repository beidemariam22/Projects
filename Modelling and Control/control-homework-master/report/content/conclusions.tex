\section{Conclusions}

Several control system models have been developed and simulated during the
realization of this homework. Key learnings that have been extracted: Optimal
trajectory is very sensible to the control system used; Feedforward action
aligns the trajectory of the manipulator with the oscillations of the reference
trajectory.
