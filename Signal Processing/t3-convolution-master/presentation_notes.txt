The central element of the convolution is this point where we
put the result
Output of convolution of two 3x3 matrices is bigger than the inputs
Convolution kernels are usually odd sized in order to easily distinguish the 
central points
Image processing usually uses "same" option of Matlab's conv function
Conv uses zero-padded edges but signal repetition might be a better assumption
for edges in signal processing
If the sum of the elements in the mask is greater than 1 it means that the
output signal will be multiplied by the sum of the mask.
Zero-padded edges makes the convolved signal have lower values than the
original signal in the edges even if the convolution kernel is normalized
Kernels with sum=0 are edge detectors

High frequencies leak through the box filter and distort the signal.
Asymmetrical box filter kernel leads to a motion blur effect if applied to an
image
