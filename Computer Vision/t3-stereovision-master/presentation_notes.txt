At a given distance, there is a given disparity
The closer to the camera, the bigger the disparity
Disparity can be zero if the object is far enough (Infinity)
There is a minimal distance for the object to be visible on both cameras. The
object can be out of the field of view of one of the cameras. The difference in
the field of view depends on the focal length "f" and the baseline between the
cameras "b". The lower the focal length the bigger the field of view but the
trade-off is lower maximum distance to sense (the camera range).
The algorithm assumes that the same points in both images lay on the same 
horizontal lines in both images -> Stereo rectification.
Checkerboard size is 40mm.
In stereo calibration, the error is usually bigger than in mono calibration.
After the rectification, both of the images get smaller.
Tune parameters for disparity function -> "dispRange" = [64, 160]; (Rule of 
thumb, divisible by 16). It should work in every image of the dataset.
Measuring horizontal features is difficult.
