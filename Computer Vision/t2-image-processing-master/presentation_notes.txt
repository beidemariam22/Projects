If we want to segment by colour, which colour space should we select?
HSV is very comfortable because we can filter by colour and get all its 
saturation and contrast.
Be careful with Open masks because they can change the corners of the objects
and even change its continuity.
For every circle it should be pi*r^2/(2*pi*r)^2 = 1/(4 pi) = area/perimeter
The bigger the eccentricity the more elongated. The lower, the rounder.
