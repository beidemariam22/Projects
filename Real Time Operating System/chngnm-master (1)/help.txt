usage: chngnm [-r|--recursive] [-s|--subdirectories] [-l|--lowercase|-u|-uppercase|-c|--capitalize] <dir/file names...> 

Change names of files and directories. Lowercasing, uppercasing or capitalizing
file and directory names either with recursion or without it.

mandatory arguments:
    renaming mode: Only one of the following arguments must be present.
    
        -l, --lowercase    Changes element names to lower case

        -u, --uppercase    Changes element names to upper case

       -c, --capitalize    Changes the first letter of the element name to
                           upper case
    
    <dir/file names...>    Names of files or directories, multiple arguments 
                           accepted.

optional arguments:
    -r, --recursive        Allows recursion. Which means that the elements
                           situated inside subdirectories of an input directory
                           will be affected. Specifying a directory as an input
                           without the "recursive" or "subdirectories" optional
                           argument will not change rename that directory

    -s, --subdirectories   Directory names are valid elements for renaming.
                           When recursion is allowed this implies that changes
                           will affect not only to regular file names but to
                           subdirectories. When recursion is not allowed, this
                           means that one can directly specify a directory to
                           be renamed. When this option is not specified,
                           directories will not be renamed

    -v, --verbose          Displays a message for each element renamed during
                           the execution
